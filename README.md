**Kick-DL is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for easily downloading VODs and Clips from kick.com**

> [!NOTE]

## Features :rocket:

- **Built-in FFmpeg**: It comes with FFmpeg integrated, allowing you to download multimedia content without needing to install FFmpeg on your system separately.

- **Global Installation**: Install it anywhere on your system and access it from any terminal with no hassle.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
- **VODs Downloads**: Download Videos on Demand (VODs) from Kick quickly with simple commands.
- **Clips Downloads**: Download Clips from Kick with ease and speed.
- **Customizable Options**: Adjust settings like format (mp4) and quality (1080p) to suit your needs.
- what's New : -modifications:
- **improved clips fetching mechanism** 🧲⚙️: To fetch all clips instead of the original ~20 clips max 🗂️
- **Now you can Download All Clips** of the selected channel. 📹
- **Concurrent Clips Download** ⏬
- **clips filter** : By time period or views. -allTime, last month, last week, last day. Sorted by : views OR most recent. 🧮

## Installation :package:

To install Kick-DL, run the following command in your terminal:

**using npm**:

```sh
npm install -g kick-dl
```

**using pnpm**:

```sh
pnpm add -g kick-dl
```
-------------------
To use open directory in terminal
```sh
kick-dl
```
> [!NOTE]
> Kick-DL leverages Puppeteer to retrieve the .m3u8 paths for VODs and clips. As a result, you may encounter occasional issues, and no driver or Google Chrome configuration is necessary.
>
> This approach is due to the absence of a Public Kick API. Once one is made available, the CLI will be updated, and performance will be improved.
